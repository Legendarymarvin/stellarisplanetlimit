If you love micro-management and want to control all yourself without giving control to greedy governors, this mod is for you. It raises the limit for planets flexible using cost-free edicts to up to ~10k. You can still create sectors if you want to. This will not affect AI. 

Compatible with 1.0.3

You will no longer start with a limit of 995, but the default 5. Instead you have a choice of empire-edicts to change your planet cap (+5, +10, +50, +100, +990, +9990), with this the mod becomes more flexible, is compatible with mods that change defines.lua and the AI will definetely not make use of the edicts. Since the edicts are cost-free you basically have still the same functionality of giving you the easy possibility to raise the cap limit!
