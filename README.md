# Flexible Core Planet Cap & Resettlement Cost

Stellaris Modification for Flexible Core Planet Cap & Resettlement Cost

**Modification for Paradox Grand Strategy Game Stellaris:**
Stellaris on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/

Can be subbed via the Workshop http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682336292 or you clone the **Git Repository** (https://github.com/metzbernhard/stellarisplanetlimit) and copy it to the Stellaris Mod-Folder. The Git Repository can also be used to get the Mod for older game versions starting with Patch 1.3.

If you love micro-management and want to control all yourself without giving control to greedy governors, this mod is for you. It raises the limit for planets flexible using cost-free edicts to up to ~10k. You can still create sectors if you want to. This will not affect AI. 

Mod also enables to change resettlement cost, but sadly this is only possible on a percentage basis and thus a little messy, especially since the value can become negative and grand resettlement.
Alternatively you can use this Addon to reduce the cost to zero flat: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818030731

Compatible with 1.8
Available in English & German!
Also available in French thanks to https://github.com/lquattro

### CHANGENOTE 21.12 ###
########################

New Mod Version thanks to lquattro, you will now have only two edicts, one for core planet cap, one for resettlement costs. THese edicts will trigger an event, that will let you decide which change you want to planet cap/resettlement cost. Disabling the edict will disable the changes. This makes the edict interface a little more tidy.
