# Flexible Core Planet Cap & Resettlement Cost

Flexible Starbase Cap, Ship Cap, Admin Cap & Resettlement Cost

This mod started out as a simple increase of the core planet cap, because even before the game released I thought players should have the option to play without sectors. Over the time it got some extra features like a resizing of the resettlement window because the default one couldn't handle having a lot of non-sectors planets.

But as the game evolved, so did the mod. It got an option to set a flexible limit on planets, other caps one might want higher got added and with 2.2 the initial reason for this mod got removed from the base game: Planet Cap & Sectors are no longer a thing in Stellaris.

These days the mod provides five edicts that fire events which the player can use to modify core aspects of the game:

\* Increase the Starbase Cap
\* Increase the Ship Cap
\* Increase the Admin Cap
\* Change Resettlement Cost
\* Get More Envoys (not resetable!)

The changes can be reset to default as well. Resettlement Cost has the problem of being weirdly implemented. So if you for example take the -100% option and have other modifiers for reducing Resettlement Cost, you will have a negative Cost. Can't be helped with the current implementation.

NOT ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE! Obviously.
The AI will not use this.
